**About**

Organizations struggle to manage their Kubernetes clusters at a level expected by various stakeholders; they are debilitated by a lack of resources, expertise and tools. Organizations need to overcome these obstacles and become Kubernetes-ready. CAPE will provide organizations with the tooling and ability to perform:

- Disaster Recovery
  - Utilize Velero, an open source Kubernetes tool for backup & restore
  - Perform single scheduled backup & restore
  - Perform multi-cluster & multi-cloud backup & restore
- Multi-cluster application deployment
- Multi-cluster DNS and ingress

CAPE enables you to manage Kubernetes clusters on day one without specialized knowledge or proprietary API/CLI experience.
